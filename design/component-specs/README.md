# Component Specs

Document component behavior in Figma before implementation.

## Required States

Every core component spec must include:

- `default`
- `hover`
- `focus`
- `disabled`
- `error`
- `loading`
- `empty`

## Required Accessibility Annotations

Each component page must include:

- contrast target and measured ratio
- focus behavior and focus ring treatment
- minimum target size guidance

## Handoff Rule

Figma is the UX/design source. Production code is implemented manually in this repository.

# Contributing

## Workflow

1. Create a branch prefixed with `codex/`.
2. Keep changes focused and atomic.
3. Add or update tests with behavior changes.
4. Run tests before opening a PR.

## Standards

- Prefer deterministic rule logic for pass/fail decisions.
- Keep LLM behavior advisory, not authoritative.
- Do not import generated design-tool code into production paths.

## Commit Quality

- Use clear commit messages.
- Include rationale for architecture or contract changes.
- Update docs when interfaces or workflows change.
